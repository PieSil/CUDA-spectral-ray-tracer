### A CUDA Spectral ray tracer

This is a project I'm currently developing for the "GPU Programming" course at the "Politecnico di Torino", it consists of a basic spectral ray tracer able to render some relatively contained hard-coded scenes.
Since the aim of this project is mainly to practice CUDA language and GPU code optimization the physical aspects are secondary, and developing a physically correct behaviour is not a priority.

It currently supports lambertian, reflective and dielectric materials, and the spectral behaviour is obtained by following the "hero wavelength" approach proposed in ...
